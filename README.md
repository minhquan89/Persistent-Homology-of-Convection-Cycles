# Persistent-Homology-of-Convection-Cycles-in-Network-Flow
We provide the code for the paper Persistent-Homology-of-Convection-Cycles-in-Network-Flows. 

The following Jupyter notebooks `contain`:

`1 Graph and persistent homology.ipynb--the codes are used to create the graph/network as in Figure 1, in line with the EVC filtration and its persistent homology.`

`2 Stationary, convection cycles and persistent barcodes--the codes describe the statinary edge flows and total imbalance together with the corresponding persistent barcodes for the total imbalance.
`

`3 Persistent homology of convecion cycles with PageRank and bifurcation diagram--the codes are used to combine the exploration of affect of Google PageRank onto convection cycles; and create the bifurcation diagram to  illustration the birth- and death-time of them.
`

`4 Application for chiral edge flows for biopolymers--the codes are the interesting application of convection cycles onto chiral edge flows for biopolymers.`

The following python files included:

`EVC_util.py--codes that utilize Gudhi to implement edge-valued clique (EVC) filtrations of functions defined on network edges
`

`util.py--codes used to implement experiments and plot results
